# Vehicle-Pickup-and-Delivery-System-AI
This project represents an application of artificial intellegence searching algorithm in real world problems. 
The single vehicle for pick up and delivery deals with a number of customer requests that must be satisfied by one vehicle with a known capacity, all requests must be served in a way
that minimizes the total travel cost of the vehicle, without violating precedence, capacity and time windows constraints. Hence, CSP approach to find the routs that served requests.
